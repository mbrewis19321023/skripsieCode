# skripsieCode
This is all the python code that you used for skripsie 

Versions will only be properly named from 2.1. Version 2.1 is the introduction of the driver folder finder functionality.
Version 1.x was the creation of the dataFrame and sanitation.

Version 1.5: renamed the path.py to mypath.py to avoid errors when using os.path 

Version 1.5.1: renamed the path.py to mypath.py to avoid errors when using os.path. Fixed README.md

Version 2.1: Began addiding functionality for going into folders and going out of them. Tried to do so using recurring function calls. Perhaps a bad idea? Sort of working. Saved as driverFind. Next time look for a simpler way to do this. Perhaps save a place in the file tree somehow?
